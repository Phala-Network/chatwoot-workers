Mirror every [Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com/) conversation into a Discord forum post, and
answer customers from Discord with slash commands and buttons. It is for support teams that
already work in Discord and use Chatwoot as their help desk, and who want humans and AI agents
to handle tickets together without leaving Discord. It runs on Cloudflare Workers (the Free plan
is enough).

- **One forum post per conversation**, kept in sync: every message, private note, and activity
  line, tagged by account, status, assignee, topic, and priority; resolved posts are archived.
- **Work from Discord.** Slash commands and each ticket's card reply, add notes, assign, label,
  snooze, resolve, and block, with the agent's own Chatwoot token, so Chatwoot's permissions and
  audit trail apply ([Commands and buttons](#commands-and-buttons)).
- **Ready for AI workflows.** Any Discord bot joins as an AI agent without integration code: it is
  called on each customer message, reads the whole ticket in its post, and proposes a reply that
  a human sends with **Reply with draft**. Budgets per ticket and per hour bound its cost
  ([Connecting an AI agent](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/ai-agent.md)).
- **AI triage with [chatwoot-router](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/tree/main/packages/chatwoot-router).**
  A separately deployed Worker assigns owners, adds topic and kind labels, and optionally sends
  canned replies or sets tickets aside. The relay holds pending bot conversations until their turn ends, and calls
  the Discord triage bot only for unanswered messages on open tickets ([Routing](#routing)).
- **A support queue.** Every hour, the tickets waiting for a reply or an assignee, pinging their
  assignees and escalating long-unassigned ones ([Support queue](#support-queue)).
- **Reliable and secure.** Work is queued durably and retried, and a sweep every 5 minutes catches
  up on new messages a missed webhook left out; webhooks and interactions are signature-checked,
  mentions are locked down, and logs hold no message bodies ([Security model](#security-model)).
- **Private configuration.** Deploy from a repository of your own with the npm package, published
  with provenance ([Deploy](#3-cloudflare)).

a minor release may change configuration or setup; the [changelog](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/CHANGELOG.md) says what to
do when it does.

## How it works

```
Chatwoot ──webhook──▶ Worker ──▶ Hub Durable Object ──▶ Discord forum post (via webhook)
Discord ─/command───▶ Worker ──▶ Hub Durable Object ──▶ Chatwoot REST API (as that agent)
Cron (every 5 min) ─▶ Worker ──▶ Hub Durable Object ──▶ sweep: catch up messages and conversation state
```

- Each conversation gets one forum post, titled `[<Account> #<id>] <customer> — <subject or first message>`.
  It opens with a ticket header (channel, inbox, customer email, phone number on phone channels,
  "Open in Chatwoot" link), every message follows under its sender's name (customers, agents,
  🔒 private notes, activity lines), and it ends with the ticket's card: its status, assignee, and
  labels, with buttons to act on it. [How conversations are relayed](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/relay.md) has the details.
- Forum tags follow the conversation: account, status (`Open`, `Pending`, `Snoozed`,
  `Resolved`), assignee or `Unassigned`, topic, priority, and labels. Resolved posts are archived.
- Agents act inside the post with the card's buttons or with [commands](#commands-and-buttons)
  such as `/reply`, `/note`, and `/resolve`. Each runs in Chatwoot with the agent's own access
  token, so Chatwoot's permissions and audit trail apply. Talking in a post never reaches the
  customer; only commands do.
- A customer message on a pending conversation with a linked inbox bot is held before posting, in the existing
  deduplicated conversation job. The status webhook and five-minute sweep wake it; one 1-second re-read covers
  a racing webhook, then the job waits without polling. Sweep wakes held jobs even outside the normal lookback.
  A fresh read releases the message when the conversation leaves pending or the bot is disconnected.
- Live customer messages ping the linked human assignee. Bots are never people: `assignee_type: AgentBot` shows
  as Unassigned, without a human tag or ping, even when its id matches a user's. For open conversations only,
  an optional Discord triage bot is mentioned when no qualifying public reply follows that customer's message.
  A reply must be outgoing, public, undeleted, not failed, not a template (greeting/out-of-office), and not an
  automatic email. Bot and human replies both count, including replies after a message outside Jev's input window.
  Resolved/snoozed messages get no triage mention. Answer scans persist only their pagination cursor across alarm
  budgets; the final page or the page containing an answer is re-read on resume. Receiving `message_updated`
  for an outgoing reply invalidates unfinished scans immediately and wakes their conversation job, including
  a failed reply retried as sent on an already-scanned middle page. An in-flight read cannot restore an invalidated
  cursor. Ordinary budget yields retain progress; updates require a fresh scan. Once decided, notification eligibility
  and hourly budgets are recorded per message, so Discord retries keep the same notification/source association.
  History and automatic customer email stay silent. A later delivery failure produces the existing notice without
  retrospective triage after the notification decision.
- Answer detection is best effort if an update webhook is lost. Chatwoot sends account webhooks once without
  retry. If a failed reply on an already-scanned page becomes sent and its `message_updated` is lost, the unfinished
  scan can miss that answer. The sweep retains the scan cursor, so requeuing the conversation does not recover
  the skipped update, even before the first Discord post. Chatwoot's messages API exposes current state by message
  ID, not changes since the last read: the retry keeps the same ID, and there is no update cursor for skipped pages.
  Rereading the reply would show its new status, but the resumed scan has no signal to do so. The customer message
  is still relayed; the impact is at most one extra triage call per affected customer message, within the existing
  notification budgets. Its recorded notification decision is not revised retrospectively.
- A human sends the proposed draft with **Reply with draft** or **Apps → Reply with this**. `/pending` assigns
  the current inbox's account bot with `assignee_type: AgentBot`, clearing the person and starting a pending turn;
  in an unlinked inbox it uses ordinary pending status. Manage preserves labels in `router.keepLabels`.
- Optionally, every hour a message lists the tickets waiting for a reply or without an assignee,
  pings their assignees, and escalates long-unassigned ones to a role ([support queue](#support-queue)). Pending
  tickets show 🤖 without pings/escalation, using the existing wait-age calculation; there is no pending timeout.
- Optionally, the separate [chatwoot-router](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/tree/main/packages/chatwoot-router)
  Worker assigns a new ticket's owner and topic through TypeSafe's System One API ([routing](#routing)).

These contracts use Chatwoot v4.18.0's
[typed assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/v4.18.0/app/services/conversations/assignment_service.rb),
[assignee presenter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/v4.18.0/app/presenters/conversations/event_data_presenter.rb),
[message types/reopen behavior](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/v4.18.0/app/models/message.rb),
[reply retries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/v4.18.0/app/controllers/api/v1/accounts/conversations/messages_controller.rb),
[update webhooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/v4.18.0/app/listeners/webhook_listener.rb),
[webhook delivery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/v4.18.0/lib/webhooks/trigger.rb), and
[message paging](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/v4.18.0/app/finders/message_finder.rb).

Design choices:

- **Chatwoot stays the system of record.** Customers, channels, history, and CSAT live in
  Chatwoot; Discord is where the team, people and bots alike, works. One post per conversation
  gives humans and an AI agent the whole ticket in one thread. Links work both ways, for machines
  too: the post URL is stored in the conversation's link attribute (`relay.linkAttribute`, default
  `discord_thread`), so anything that reads Chatwoot's API (for example a queue digest) can link
  to the post; the ticket header links back to Chatwoot.
- **An AI agent joins without code changes.** Each eligible unanswered customer message ends with a literal
  `<@bot>` mention of the bot set in `triage.userId`. Discord bots commonly react to other bots'
  messages only when mentioned inline, so the agent wakes up for customer messages and nothing
  else: agent replies, private notes, and activity lines carry no mention. The relay's
  `allowed_mentions` suppresses the notification, so the token pings no human. See
  [Connecting an AI agent](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/ai-agent.md).
- **The AI drafts, humans send.** The agent writes its proposed reply as the last fenced code
  block of its answer. A human opens the reply editor prefilled with it, edits if needed, and
  submits.
- **Cost and abuse are bounded.** At most `triage.perConversationPerHour` (5) customer messages
  per conversation and `triage.perHour` (30) in total call the agent each hour; beyond that a
  visible note replaces the mention, as it does on a customer message a routing kind's reply
  already answered. Messages from blocked contacts are never relayed.
- **Reliable by construction.** Chatwoot sends each webhook once, without retry, so webhooks are
  only triggers: the Worker queues the work durably in one Durable Object, which reads Chatwoot's
  API, retries failed work until it succeeds, and sweeps every 5 minutes for missed messages and conversation state
  ([Internals](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/internals.md) says what the sweep does not cover).

## Deploy

You need a Cloudflare account, a Chatwoot instance (v4.18 or later) reachable from the internet,
and a Discord server where you can add an application and a forum channel. To install on a
Chatwoot that already has conversations, or to replace another relay, read
[Operations](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/operations.md) first.

### 1. Discord

1. Create an application at <https://discord.com/developers/applications>; note its
   **Application ID** and **Public Key**, and create a **bot token**. No privileged intent is
   needed: **Reply with draft** takes the draft the triage bot's hook sends (see
   [Triage bot hook](#triage-bot-hook)). The **Message Content** intent only lets it read an answer
   whose draft was not kept (an app in 100 or more servers, or exposed to a large one, needs
   Discord's review first).
2. Invite the bot with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
3. Create a **forum channel**. Give the bot *View Channels*, *Read Message History* (**Use
   draft**), *Manage Threads* (tags, archiving), and *Manage Webhooks* (it creates a webhook,
   named `Chatwoot`, that posts the messages; it only uses a webhook its own application created).
4. Create the forum tags you want: one per account, one per status (`Open`, `Pending`,
   `Snoozed`, `Resolved`), one for unassigned posts, one per agent, one per topic value, and any
   priorities and Chatwoot labels you want to see. A forum has at most 20 tags. Their names are
   only shown to people: the relay binds each tag by its id in `forumTags`, so a tag can be
   renamed freely. List the ids, after `npm ci` in a checkout, with
   `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=... npm run forum-tags -- --forum <forum channel id>`. If the forum's
   **Require tags** setting is on, make sure every post gets at least one tag (for example the
   account tag), or Discord rejects the new post.

### 2. Chatwoot

1. Create a relay user (e.g. "Discord Relay") that is an agent in every relayed inbox, or an
   administrator, and copy its access token (Profile → Access Token). It only reads, and writes
   the link attribute.
2. In each account, add a **conversation custom attribute** `discord_thread` with display type
   *Link* (or set `relay.linkAttribute` to another key, or `""` to disable).
3. Each agent who will use commands creates their own access token.

The account must have the API/webhooks feature enabled (it is by default on self-hosted).

### 3. Cloudflare

Deploy with the [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/) (`cf`, in beta), from a
checkout of this repository or from a repository of your own. Requirements: Node 24 (24.15 or
later) and npm (the version in `packageManager` in `package.json`); sign in once with
`npx cf auth login`.

The secrets are described in [`.dev.vars.example`](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/.dev.vars.example) and the
[secrets table](#secrets). Copy it to a file outside the repository and fill it in, with `{}` for
`CHATWOOT_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` until step 4 and `{"<discord user id>":"<chatwoot token>"}` for
`CHATWOOT_AGENT_TOKENS`, then pass it to the first deploy with `--secrets-file`. Later deploys keep
the secrets; to change some, deploy again with a file that holds only those (the others are kept).
Every configured account needs a webhook secret: until step 4 supplies them, configuration is not ready and
`/healthz` returns 503.
Do not leave the file lying around: it holds every credential.

**From a checkout.** Install dependencies at the workspace root, then deploy the package.
Run npm and build commands inside Docker as shown in the root contribution guide.

```sh
npm ci
cd packages/chatwoot-discord-relay
# Replace the placeholder CONFIG in cloudflare.config.ts (see the configuration reference).
npx cf deploy --secrets-file <secrets file>
```

**From a repository of your own**, to keep your configuration private: depend on the
[`chatwoot-discord-relay`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatwoot-discord-relay) package,
published from this repository's releases with npm provenance, at an exact version. Your project
needs `cf`, `vite`, and `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` as dev dependencies, a `vite.config.ts` like this
repository's, `src/index.ts` with `export { default, Hub } from "chatwoot-discord-relay";`, the
configuration as JSON with comments in a file of its own (`config.jsonc`), and a
`cloudflare.config.ts` that binds a [KV namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) and the
configuration's key instead of `CONFIG`:

```ts
import { bindings, defineConfig, exports, triggers } from "cf/config";
import { storedConfig } from "chatwoot-discord-relay/stored-config";

export default defineConfig({
  accountId: "<account id>",
  worker: {
    name: "chatwoot-discord-relay",
    entrypoint: "src/index.ts",
    compatibilityDate: "2026-08-15",
    domains: ["<worker host>"],
    triggers: [triggers.scheduled({ schedule: "*/5 * * * *" })],
    exports: { Hub: exports.durableObject({ storage: "sqlite" }) },
    env: {
      HUB: bindings.durableObject({ worker: "chatwoot-discord-relay", exportName: "Hub" }),
      CONFIG_STORE: bindings.kv({ id: "<namespace id>" }),
      CONFIG_KEY: bindings.text(storedConfig(new URL("config.jsonc", import.meta.url)).key),
    },
  },
});
```

Store the configuration, then deploy. In CI, follow [Use cf in CI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/ci/)
without `--mode` (this configuration has no modes): `npx cf build`, then `npx cf deploy --prebuilt` after storing
the configuration. By hand:

```sh
npx cf kv namespaces create --title chatwoot-discord-relay-config   # once
npx chatwoot-discord-store-config config.jsonc --namespace-id <namespace id> && npx cf deploy
```

Both validate the file. Its key is derived from its content, so each version reads the configuration
it was deployed with, also after a rollback (stored keys are kept). KV is eventually consistent: a
read that fails is retried with the next request. This is also the way to deploy a configuration
larger than the 5 KB a var holds; in this repository, the same command is
`npm run -s store-config --`, and `cloudflare.config.ts` imports `./scripts/stored-config.ts`.

Whichever way you deploy, check the Worker: `curl https://<worker>/healthz` answers
`{"ok":true}`, or 503 while the configuration or a secret is invalid; the reason is in Workers
Logs. It checks the configuration only: send a test message to check that Chatwoot, the Worker,
and Discord reach each other.

### 4. Connect

1. In the Discord application, set **Interactions Endpoint URL** to
   `https://<worker>/discord/interactions`. Discord verifies it with a signed request, so the
   Worker must be deployed first.
2. Register the commands in your server (again whenever `src/commands/definitions.ts` changes),
   from a checkout after `npm ci`:
   ```sh
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=... npm run register-commands -- --application <app id> --guild <guild id>
   ```
3. In each Chatwoot account, add a webhook (Settings → Integrations → Webhooks) for
   `https://<worker>/chatwoot/webhook`, subscribed to `message_created`, `message_updated`
   (deleted messages, responses to interactive messages, and replies that could not be
   delivered), `conversation_updated` (assignee, topic, priority, and labels), and
   `conversation_status_changed`. Then store the webhook secrets by account id,
   `{"<account id>":"<webhook secret>"}`, in the `CHATWOOT_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` secret.

## Commands and buttons

Commands and buttons work inside a ticket post, for Discord users linked in `agents[]` who have a
token in `CHATWOOT_AGENT_TOKENS`; others get a refusal only they see.

**The card.** Every post ends with the ticket's card, coloured by its status: the ticket and its
customer; the channel, the customer's email or phone number, and a link to Chatwoot; the status,
the assignee, and the labels. Then a row of buttons per concern:

1. Answering: **Write reply**, led by **Reply with draft** (highlighted) after a triage bot's
   answer with a draft.
2. Who owns the ticket: **Take**, and **Assign to…**, named after the assignee once there is one.
3. Its state: **Resolve** and **Snooze** while it is open or pending; **Reopen** and **Resolve**
   while it is snoozed; **Reopen** once it is resolved; then **Block** and **Manage**.

The card is edited when the ticket changes (at once after a button or command), and moves to the
bottom (posted again, the previous one deleted) when the relay posts messages or the triage bot
reports an answer, so a post has one card, under the latest of those (a message posted in
Discord by anyone else does not move it). After a triage bot's answer with a draft, reported by
the bot's [hook](#triage-bot-hook), the card moves under the answer and is led by **Reply with
draft** until the customer writes again. A post from before cards gets its card from the sweep
while its ticket is not resolved, or with its next message; buttons under older messages keep
working, and the commands work everywhere.

| Command | Card button | Effect in Chatwoot |
|---|---|---|
| `/reply [message] [attachment]` | **Write reply** | Without options, an editor with a message field and an optional upload field; with either option, sends it at once. Sends to the customer; an unassigned conversation is assigned to the sender. Refused when the channel does not accept a reply (Chatwoot's `can_reply`, e.g. after WhatsApp's 24-hour window). With `chatwoot.sendAsAgent`, the editor's **Send from my email address** sends an email reply from the agent's own mailbox name on the inbox's domain (alice@corp.example answering support@acme.example sends as alice@acme.example); it needs a Chatwoot build that reads `content_attributes.send_as_agent` ([Phala-Network/chatwoot](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot), `phala/*` branches), so it is off by default. |
| Apps → **Reply with this** (message menu) | **Reply with draft** | The `/reply` editor, prefilled. **Reply with this**: from the triage bot, the last code block of its message (none: no draft); from anyone else, the last code block or the whole message. **Reply with draft**: the draft the hook sent, or else the answer's last code block read from Discord, which needs the Message Content intent; without it, it links to the answer for **Reply with this**. |
| `/note [message] [attachment]` | | Like `/reply`, for a private note. |
| `/resolve`, `/reopen` | **Resolve**, **Reopen** | Change the status. |
| `/pending` | | Hand back to the inbox bot; ordinary pending status when no bot is linked. |
| `/snooze [until]` | **Snooze** | Snooze until the next reply (default, and the button) or for an hour. A reply from the contact always reopens it. |
| `/priority <level>` | | Set the priority (`Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`), or clear it with `None`. |
| `/assign [agent]` | **Take**, **Assign to…** | Assign to yourself (**Take**) or another linked Discord user, who must be an agent of the account. **Assign to…** shows you a menu of the account's agents (and Unassigned), and the menu turns into the result. |
| `/unassign` | | Remove the assignee, like choosing "None" as the assignee in Chatwoot. |
| `/label add <label>`, `/label remove <label>` | | Add one of the account's labels, or remove one of the conversation's; the other labels stay. The name is matched in lower case, as Chatwoot stores labels. |
| `/block` | **Block** | Like Chatwoot's "Block contact": resolves the conversation and blocks the contact, so their future messages are muted. The button asks you to confirm first (only you see the question). |
| `/unblock` | | Like Chatwoot's "Unblock contact": their new messages are posted again (messages received while blocked are not). The status is unchanged. |
| | **Manage** | A card only you see, to change the assignee, the label, and the status (below). |

![The Manage card: menus for the assignee and the label, and Open, Resolved, and Snooze buttons with the current status highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/assets/manage.png)

**Manage** opens a card only you see, drawn with the ticket as it is and coloured by its status:
menus for its assignee and its label (the card sets the one topic label: choosing one replaces
the ticket's labels except its [kinds](#routing)), and **Open**, **Resolved**, and **Snooze** (until
the next reply) buttons with the current status highlighted. A change is made at once, and the
card is drawn again with the result; a change someone else makes shows the next time it is
drawn. A menu lists at most 25 choices (the current assignee and label among them; a label
longer than a menu option can be is named in the menu's placeholder instead, and changed in
Chatwoot); assign other linked agents with `/assign` (agents not linked to Discord in Chatwoot),
and set priority, "pending", and several labels with `/priority`, `/pending`, and `/label`.

The invoker of a command sees an ephemeral "thinking…" that is replaced by the result. A slash
command's `message` option is a single line of text and `attachment` is one file: use the editor
(no options) for multi-line text or several files. Chatwoot's other snooze options reopen at a
time of day in the agent's browser time zone, which Discord does not share; use Chatwoot for
those. Discord does not allow commands in an archived post: in a resolved post, first send any
message, which unarchives it. The relay archives it again on its next update while the
conversation is resolved.

## Configuration reference

Non-secret settings live in `CONFIG` in `cloudflare.config.ts`, validated at startup; an
unknown key (for example a typo) makes it invalid. The committed values are placeholders to
replace. A var holds at most 5 KB ([Workers limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/)):
a larger configuration goes in a [KV namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) bound as
`CONFIG_STORE`, under the key in the `CONFIG_KEY` var, as when deploying
[from a repository of your own](#3-cloudflare). Set `CONFIG` or `CONFIG_KEY`, not both.

| Key | Type and constraints | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chatwoot.baseUrl` | http(s) URL | required | Chatwoot base URL for API calls. |
| `chatwoot.publicUrl` | http(s) URL | `baseUrl` | Base URL for dashboard links posted in Discord. |
| `chatwoot.sendAsAgent` | boolean | `false` | The Chatwoot build sends email replies with `content_attributes.send_as_agent` from the agent's own address; the reply editor offers **Send from my email address**. |
| `accounts[]` | at least one; unique `id` | required | Relayed Chatwoot accounts. Accounts may share a forum. |
| `accounts[].id` | integer > 0 | required | Chatwoot account id. |
| `accounts[].name` | non-empty string | required | Shown in post titles (`[<name> #12] …`) and command confirmations. |
| `accounts[].forumChannelId` | Discord id (17–20 digits) | required | The forum channel of the account's posts. |
| `accounts[].inboxIds` | non-empty array of integers > 0 | every inbox | Relay only conversations of these inboxes. |
| `agents[]` | unique `discordUserId`, unique `chatwootUserId` | `[]` | Links Discord users to Chatwoot agents: commands, assignee pings, mentions in private notes, `/assign` targets, and the Discord avatar on the agent's messages. |
| `agents[].discordUserId` | Discord id (17–20 digits) | required | The agent's Discord user. |
| `agents[].chatwootUserId` | integer > 0 | required | The agent's Chatwoot user id, the same in every account: the `id` from `GET /api/v1/profile` with the agent's own access token, or from an administrator's `GET /api/v1/accounts/<account id>/agents`. |
| `forumTags` | object: forum channel id → (key → tag id) | `{}` | The forum tags posts get, by what each tag stands for.

### Secrets

Worker secrets, never in the configuration, also validated at startup:

| Secret | Format | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | non-empty | The Discord application's bot token. |
| `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` | 64 hex characters | The Discord application's public key (verifies interactions). |
| `CHATWOOT_RELAY_TOKEN` | non-empty | Access token of the Chatwoot user the relay reads as (an agent in every relayed inbox, or an administrator). |
| `CHATWOOT_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` | JSON object, `{"<account id>":"<secret>"}` | Required for every configured account; missing entries fail configuration validation. |
| `CHATWOOT_AGENT_TOKENS` | JSON object, `{"<Discord user id>":"<token>"}`; optional, default `{}` | Each linked agent's own Chatwoot access token; commands act with it. |
| `TRIAGE_HOOK_SECRET` | 32+ characters; optional | Signs the triage bot's hook ([triage bot hook](#triage-bot-hook)). Unset: the route is off. |

## Routing

The router calls TypeSafe's System One API (`/v1/systemone`) with the model in its `routing.model` setting
(Jev by default). System One is TypeSafe's class of decision models; Jev is its first model. The router's
`routing.endpoint` may point to another deployment of that API, for example a proxy or gateway.

[chatwoot-router](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/tree/main/packages/chatwoot-router) runs as each account's native Chatwoot brand bot. The relay
uses Chatwoot's inbox-bot association and pending status automatically; it needs neither bot credentials nor
custom routing attributes. `GET inboxes/{id}/agent_bot` is scoped to the account/inbox and validated for that
account. An unlinked inbox has no bot; the endpoint does not expose the association's active flag, so disconnect
it to disable holding. The relay's user token must see every relayed inbox. The bot webhook belongs to the router;
the relay keeps its own account webhook, including `conversation_status_changed`.

The [How it works](#how-it-works) rules define pending holding and answering replies. A greeting stays in
Chatwoot until the bot's turn ends. There is no per-message wait timeout. Router processing failures select
handoff after three attempts, while Worker delivery failures use Chatwoot's fallback unless that account enables
`keep_pending_on_bot_failure`. A native error fallback may leave open plus a bot assignee; the relay treats it as
unassigned for normal triage/queue handling; the router releases the remaining bot assignment on a job or sweep. A permission or service failure needs repair; no timer promises success.

To upgrade from relay 0.29.0/router 0.1.0, deploy this relay **first**, remove `router.accounts` and
`router.waitSeconds`, and put every kind name in `router.keepLabels`, e.g. `["spam", "security", "beg-bounty"]`.
Keep the existing Worker names and Durable Object state. Stop the old router's account webhook and cron before
replacing it, then deploy the new router with its bot ids/tokens/secrets, and finally connect bots one account
at a time. Never run both routers. Existing open tickets remain with people; existing pending tickets are routed.
During the relay-first transition, open messages can go straight to triage.

Keep existing `routing_*` attributes/definitions through the owner's rollback window. For rollback, disconnect
bots and keep the router running until pending/open account sweeps and durable ending retries leave no
brand-bot-owned tickets. Pending uses native handoff; open leftovers use explicit unassignment; resolved/snoozed
kind endings release the bot in the same turn, preserving status. Confirm cleared ownership across statuses,
then stop router entry, cron,
queued alarms and in-flight work, retaining its DO namespace/storage (reply attempts/observed records and turn
guards cannot be rebuilt from history). Restore the recorded live relay 0.27 version and CONFIG_KEY with its
original Hub. Its `kind-reply:<account>:<conversation>` ledger is independent of the Router's
`reply:<account>:<conversation>` ledger: version/config rollback transfers no records and does not guarantee
reply-once for Router-only replies or unknown attempts. Retain both DOs and review/isolate those tickets before
resuming old routing. The relay sweep releases held jobs after disconnect. See the
router's [upgrade and rollback instructions](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/tree/main/packages/chatwoot-router#upgrade-and-rollback).

## Triage bot hook

The Worker does not see Discord messages, so a triage bot's side reports each answer once it is
in the post: `POST
/triage/answered` with `{"threadId":"<post id>","answerId":"<answer message id>","replyTo":"<the
message it answers>","draft":"<the reply draft>"}`, signed like a Chatwoot webhook (`x-timestamp`, Unix seconds, and `x-signature`,
`sha256=` and the hex HMAC-SHA256 of `<timestamp>.<body>` with `TRIAGE_HOOK_SECRET`). The Worker
keeps the draft for 14 days and moves the post's card under the answer, led by **Reply with draft**,
once per answer (a repeated call adds nothing), while the message it answers is the customer's
latest (an answer to an earlier one, or older than one already reported, changes nothing). Report only answers that have a draft, and only
after they were sent, so the card follows them (right after the answer unless another message
came in between). The hook is a convenience: if a call is lost, the card offers no draft, and
**Reply with this** still works. See [Connecting an AI agent](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/ai-agent.md) for the agent's side.

## Support queue

With `queue`, the cron run at minute 0 of every hour posts a message in `queue.channelId` that lists
the open tickets of every account whose customer waits for a reply (Chatwoot's `waiting_since`) or
that have no assignee, longest wait first: each line is the ticket's post (or its dashboard link),
how long the customer has waited, and its assignee, whom it pings when they are a linked agent. A
ticket with no assignee pings `queue.escalationRoleId` (or `escalationUserId`) after its customer
has waited 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 hours, and every 24 hours after that, once per step, until someone
takes it or replies. Snoozed tickets and pending bot turns are listed after them, marked 💤 and 🤖 respectively,
without pings or escalations. Pending age uses the existing `waiting_since`; it is not the current turn's start.
Nothing is posted when there is no such ticket. A line holds no customer text, and mentions are
allowed from the tickets' fields only, never from text. The queue reads up to four pages (100
tickets) of open tickets, one page (25) of snoozed and one page of pending per account and takes at most four
messages; tickets beyond that are counted at the end.

## Security model

- Chatwoot webhooks: HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Chatwoot-Signature`, `sha256=` + HMAC of
  `"<timestamp>.<raw body>"`) with a per-account secret, verified in constant time (WebCrypto),
  ±5 minute timestamp window, and the signing account must match the payload. A replayed webhook
  only queues a sync, which changes nothing when the post is up to date.
- Discord interactions: Ed25519 signature verified (`discord-interactions`) before parsing;
  unsigned requests, and requests signed more than 5 minutes ago, get 401. A command is queued
  once per interaction id, so a replayed request never runs it again.
- A command runs with the invoker's own Chatwoot token only if that token's user is the Chatwoot
  user `CONFIG` links them to; a token stored for the wrong Discord user does nothing.
- Chatwoot and Discord API requests never follow redirects, which could carry a token to another
  host.
- Commands act only for linked users; others get an ephemeral refusal. The ticket is resolved
  from the stored post → conversation mapping, never from the post title.
- Discord messages are sent with `allowed_mentions` locked down; only linked agents can be
  pinged: the conversation's assignee, and agents mentioned in a private note; the support queue
  also pings its configured escalation role or user. Customer text
  cannot call a bot either (see [Message content](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/packages/chatwoot-discord-relay/docs/relay.md#message-content)).
- Attachments are fetched only from Discord's CDN (`cdn.discordapp.com`, `media.discordapp.net`)
  over HTTPS, without following redirects, with size caps.
- Logs carry ids and outcomes only, never message bodies or tokens. Errors shown to users are
  generic; details go to Workers Logs (`observability` in `cloudflare.config.ts`).

## Limits and the Workers Free plan

| Free plan limit | How this service stays within it |
|---|---|
| 10 ms CPU per Worker request | The Worker verifies a signature, parses JSON, and makes one Durable Object call. Bodies over 2 MB are rejected; a very large webhook that fails is relayed by the next sweep. |
| 50 subrequests per invocation | Alarms count requests against `relay.subrequestBudget` and yield to a fresh invocation before it runs out. A conversation run needs 6 requests to set up; it starts a message only while `relay.maxChunks` + 24 requests remain (its parts, 13 for everything else a message may need, and 11 to finish the run), so the budget must be at least `relay.maxChunks` + 30 (`src/relay/limits.ts`). A command starts only with 20 left, a sweep page with 1. |
| 128 MB memory | Attachments are capped at 25 MB each / 50 MB per command. |
| 100,000 Worker requests/day | See the estimate below. |
| Durable Objects (SQLite): 100,000 requests/day, 100,000 rows written/day | See the estimate below. |
| 5 cron triggers | One is used. |

Estimate for a busy desk, **1,000 Chatwoot messages and 200 commands per day**: about 2,000
webhook requests (Chatwoot sends about 2 per message), 200 interaction requests, and 288 cron
runs, **≈2,500 Worker requests/day (2.5%)**; 2,000 enqueues, ~400 command lookups and enqueues,
288 sweeps, and up to ~2,700 alarm runs, **≈5,400 Durable Object requests/day (5.4%)**; roughly
12–18 rows written per relayed message plus a few per command and sweep, **≈18,000/day (18%)**.
Each relayed message needs about 3–6 subrequests. Durable Object duration is also metered; check
Cloudflare's current pricing for the Free allowance.

## Development

Run these commands inside Docker; the root [contribution guide](https://github.com/Phala-Network/chatwoot-workers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
has the complete container command and checks both packages.

```sh
npm ci
cd packages/chatwoot-discord-relay
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test   # tests run inside workerd (@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers)
npm run build                                   # cf build into .cloudflare/output (no deploy)
npm run dev                                     # local Worker (cf dev); copy .dev.vars.example to .dev.vars first
npm run types                                   # regenerate .cloudflare/types (typecheck runs it)
npm run gen:chatwoot                            # regenerate ../../shared/chatwoot/schema.d.ts (Chatwoot v4.18.0 OpenAPI)
sh docs/assets/render.sh                        # re-render the README illustrations (needs Docker)
