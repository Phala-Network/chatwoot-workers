# How conversations are relayed

What the relay posts in a ticket's forum post, and how it handles the less common cases. See the
[README](../README.md) for an overview, and [Internals](internals.md) for how it is built.

## Posts and messages

- Every conversation of a configured account is relayed, or only those of the inboxes in
  `accounts[].inboxIds` when it is set. Messages from blocked contacts are not relayed.
- Each conversation gets one forum post, titled `[<Account> #<id>] <customer> — <subject or first
  message>`. It opens with a ticket header (channel, inbox, customer email, phone number on phone
  channels, the customer's 5 latest earlier tickets in the account, each linked to its post or
  else to Chatwoot, and an "Open in Chatwoot" link), and every message follows it. Bots act on a
  post's replies but not on its opening message, so the header lets the first customer message
  reach a triage bot like any other.
- Messages are posted through the forum webhook, so each shows its sender's name and avatar:
  customers (their https Chatwoot avatar, else `avatars.contact`), agents as `Name · Account`, agent
  bots by their name and https Chatwoot avatar (else `avatars.chatwoot`), and
  everything else as `Chatwoot` (`avatars.chatwoot`). Templates (greetings, CSAT) and messages
  with nothing to show are skipped.
- An agent's replies and notes show the Discord avatar of the agent's linked Discord user
  (`agents[]`), else the agent's https Chatwoot avatar, else `avatars.chatwoot`. The bot looks
  each linked agent up at most once a day (one extra Discord request); if that fails, it uses the
  fallback and tries again an hour later.
- The post title follows the contact's name when it changes (on the conversation's next sync);
  posts adopted from another relay or created by earlier versions keep their title.

## Tags and archiving

Tags are the forum's `forumTags` for what the conversation has; anything without a tag there is
skipped. Discord applies at most 5 per post, taken in this order: account, status, assignee
(by Chatwoot user id, so a renamed agent keeps their tag), topic (the conversation's
`relay.topicAttribute` custom attribute), priority, then labels. A resolved conversation's post
is archived; any other status unarchives it. When Discord refuses a request because a tag was
deleted in Discord, it is sent again without the missing tags, and a warning names them.

## Pings and notifications

- A newly assigned agent who is linked in `agents[]` is pinged once (a change of their Chatwoot
  name does not count as a new assignment), in Chatwoot's assignment line that names them
  (`Assigned to @name by Sam`; after several reassignments in a row, the line naming the last
  one), and is added to the post, so it shows in their thread list (if Discord refuses, e.g.
  they left the server, only a warning is logged). Chatwoot may create the line a little after
  the assignment; when no such line comes within 2 minutes (e.g. a conversation assigned at
  creation), a `-# Assigned to @name` notice pings them instead. Customer messages do not ping
  them while their announcement waits. After that, every
  customer message pings the linked assignee, on a line at its end. A linked
  agent @mentioned in a private note is pinged there; other Chatwoot mentions show as `@name`.
  Nothing else pings anyone.
- Notification lines (pings, triage budget notes) go on the last Discord message of a split
  message. The triage bot is called in a notice of its own, the last message of the run: after
  the run's messages (with a routing bot's labels, assignment and status lines), the assignee's
  announcement and the card, which stays above it. So the bot reads the whole run, and nothing the
  run posts reaches it as a follow-up. Only live messages notify: messages created more than
  `reconcile.lookbackSeconds` ago (the history of an older conversation, or a catch-up after
  downtime) are posted without notifications.

## Message content

- Chatwoot's activity lines (assignments, status changes, labels) are small italic text
  (`-# _Resolved by Sam_`), like the relay's own notices, so the conversation stands out.
- Messages longer than Discord's 2000 characters are split at line breaks, at most
  `relay.maxChunks` (4) Discord messages, then a "Message truncated … Full text: <link>" note.
- An email is posted without the earlier emails it quotes, as Chatwoot itself forwards it (its
  processed content: the reply part of the text body, else of the HTML body). An automatic
  reply (Chatwoot's `auto_reply` flag, from the `Auto-Submitted` or `X-Autoreply` header) is
  posted without notifications.
- Shared contacts and locations, which have no file, are shown as a 📇 or 📍 line; Instagram
  story mentions and reels, and content a channel could only describe (Chatwoot's `fallback`), as
  a labelled 📎 link; a LINE sticker as its image link. A bot's options, cards, and articles are
  listed with their links.
- Customer text cannot call a bot or pass for the relay's own lines: mention tokens (`<@…>`,
  `<@&…>`, `<#…>`, `</…>`), `@everyone`, `@here`, and a `-#` at the start of a line get a
  zero-width space.

## Changes after posting

- A message deleted in Chatwoot is deleted from the post once Chatwoot's API confirms it, with
  the response and notice posted about it; when the post's title quotes it, the title keeps only
  the ticket and the customer. This uses the forum webhook that posted them; if that webhook was
  deleted in Discord (the relay then creates a new one), its messages stay, because the bot has no
  permission to delete others' messages.
- A customer's response to an interactive message (option pick, form, CSAT rating, email
  request) is posted under the customer's name, formatted like Chatwoot's Slack integration. A
  changed response is posted again; an unchanged one is not. A response (or a delivery failure)
  that exists when its message is first relayed is posted with it.
- A reply the channel could not deliver (Chatwoot marks it failed, e.g. outside WhatsApp's
  24-hour window) gets one ⚠️ notice in the post with the channel's reason.
- A conversation deleted in Chatwoot gets a notice in its post, which is archived and forgotten.
  Chatwoot sends no webhook for a deletion (v4.18.0), so this happens when the next event for it
  arrives or a command in the post finds it gone.

## Failures

A post deleted in Discord is recreated on the next message. A message Discord refuses as
invalid (an HTTP 4xx other than 401, 403, 404, 408, and 429) is skipped with a ⚠️ notice in its
post after `relay.maxAttempts` (5) attempts. Rate limits, Discord server errors, timeouts, and
missing permissions never skip a message: its job retries until Discord accepts it, and waits
as long as Discord asks when rate limited.
